https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJEHuBZQ5dU JavaScript ES6 / ES2015 - [10] Promises

Promises represent alternative system for managing async request in codebase by callbacks.

The promise constructor takes one argument, a callback with two parameters, resolve and reject.
 Do something within the callback, perhaps async, then call resolve if everything worked, otherwise call reject. 
 Like throw in plain old JavaScript, it's customary, but not required, to reject with an Error object.

var myPromise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){
  setTimeout(() => resolve(4), 2000);
});
myPromise.then((res) => {res +=3;
  console.log(res);
});
Promise is design pattern
Promise libraries are q,bluebird

Deffered Object and Promise Object
Deffered object have property promise and promise itself have 2 property promiseStatus and value by default status is pending 
and PromiseValue default undefined

deffered have 2 functions resolve and reject
promise have 2 functions then and catch
=======
create defeered object -------
========
var deferred = Promise.defer()
Promise.all(p1,p2,p3)
 chain Promise
 by Promise.

3 different task are in progress and then sum up
